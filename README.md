## Tasks 1 and 2
Tasks 1.1, 1.2 and 2 are implemented between the files main.py and utils.py. 

Detection file, noise configuration and visualization options are chosen by cmd command. Despite that, somo important "global" variables are:

VIDEO_PATH = *path to vdo.avi*
ANNOTATIONS_FILE = *path to annotations.xml with complete ground truth data (including still objects, bikes and cars)*

> This file can be parsed with the function utils.parse_xml_rects

Please, find python dependencies on week1/requirements.txt

DET_PATH = *path to AICity detection data*

> This file can be parsed with the function utils.parse_aicity_rects. Path to rcnn, yolo and ssd detections already on the script. Select using the option: mode.
